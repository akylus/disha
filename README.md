<i>Delegation, Interaction and Scholarly Help Application</i>
<br>

In this ever-growing world of technology, the necessity of having a bridge of communication between the students and the industry is deemed extremely necessary.

A student after passing out, in many cases undergoes additional training at the company he joins in order to be able to serve the company efficiently.

This can be eliminated by forming an online discussion forum for the student community of the college where the students can communicate with the alumni of the college for various opportunities and scholarly help.

The social interaction and the collaborative nature in Online Discussion Forum environments and the active learning opportunities provided by the Alumni are likely to result in an advanced skill set when students utilize the project building opportunities to enhance the traditional learning approach.

A forum exclusive to the college can heighten the chances of a network for the student which can help him/her for lifetime. This can also prove to be a great source for students who are willing to do freelancing which can also help them hone their skills.
